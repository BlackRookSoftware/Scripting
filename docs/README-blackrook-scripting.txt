==== Introduction

The purpose of the Scripting library is to allow programmers to create simple,
yet powerful scripting components for host programs and creating a means to
link them into the host program easily.

==== Languages

The current included language in the scripting library is SimpleScript, an
iterative, command-driven script system. Included is a parser and classes
to assist in writing interpreters and readers for specialized SimpleScripts.
Comes with a sample descriptor and interpreter for making realtime scripts
and can serve as a base for more powerful script types.

==== Library

Contained in this release is a series of libraries that enable the user to
create scripts and other interpreted data of this type and link them to
a host program.
